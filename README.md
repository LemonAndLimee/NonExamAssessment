# NonExamAssessment
A Level AQA NEA Project. This is a simulation of natural selection in a population.

A population of circles move around randomly until  they "see" a piece of green food (this occurs when the food is within their vision range, highlighted by the translucent circle around them). They then target and "eat" this food, increasing their energy level. If their energy level reaches zero, they die.

Each circle has four character traits: speed, sight range, size, and ideal temperature. A higher speed, sight range or size means a higher energy cost, and there will also be a higher energy cost if the ideal temperature is different from the environment temperature.

At regular time intervals, all alive circles will "reproduce", making a clone of themselves. The clone has a small chance to have slightly different values for each character trait. Therefore the population evolves to best suit the environment.

Over time, the population becomes more varied.

All variables in this simulation can be controlled by the user in the settings. This simulation comes with a full UI, including a tutorial, pause/play button, help icons, and a graph to track the character traits over time.
